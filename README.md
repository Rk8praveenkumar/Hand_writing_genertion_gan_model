# Hand_writing_genertion_gan_model
In this project, we utilize a GAN architecture consisting of a generator network and a discriminator network. The generator network learns to generate realistic handwritten digits, while the discriminator network learns to differentiate between real handwritten digits from the dataset and the fake digits generated by the generator
